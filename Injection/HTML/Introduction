HTML injection, also known as "HTML injection attack," is a type of web security vulnerability in which an attacker can inject malicious code into a web page that is viewed by other users.
HTML injection typically occurs when a web application does not properly sanitize user input, such as data entered into a form field or a URL parameter, before rendering it as HTML. This allows an attacker to inject code, such as JavaScript, into the web page that can be executed by the victim's browser.

# Impact of HTML injection:-
~ An attack can range from the theft of sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, to the complete takeover of the victim's session or the web server itself. 

~ HTML injection attacks can also be used in conjunction with other attacks, such as phishing attacks or cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, to further compromise the victim's system.

# Prevention:-
~ web developers should implement proper input validation and output encoding techniques to ensure that user inputs are properly sanitized before being displayed on a web page.
