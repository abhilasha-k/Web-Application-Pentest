Web reconnaissance, also known as "web recon," is the process of gathering information about a target or organization by analyzing its online presence, including its websites, social media accounts, online directories, and other publicly available information. The purpose of web reconnaissance is to gain a better understanding of the target's digital footprint, identify potential vulnerabilities, and gather intelligence that could be used for various purposes such as security assessments, competitive intelligence, or cybercrime investigations. Techniques used in web recon may include open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, web scraping, social engineering, and other forms of data mining.
