Web reconnaissance, also known as "web recon," is the process of gathering information about a target or organization by analyzing its online presence, including its websites, social media accounts, online directories, and other publicly available information. 
The purpose of web reconnaissance is to gain a better understanding of the target's digital footprint, identify potential vulnerabilities, and gather intelligence that could be used for various purposes such as security assessments, competitive intelligence, or cybercrime investigations. Techniques used in web recon may include open-source intelligence (OSINT) gathering, web scraping, social engineering, and other forms of data mining.


The phases of web reconnaissance can be broadly divided into the following steps:

Planning: This involves defining the scope of the web recon, setting objectives, and identifying the tools and techniques to be used. This phase is critical as it helps to ensure that the web recon is aligned with the goals of the organization and does not violate any laws or ethical standards.
This can be done using tools such as Nmap, Fping, and Whois.

Information gathering: In this phase, the attacker collects information about the target using various sources such as search engines, social media platforms, and online directories. This can involve collecting information such as domain names, email addresses, IP addresses, and contact details of employees.

Target analysis: This phase involves analyzing the information gathered in the previous phase to identify potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors. 
This can involve using tools such as vulnerability scanners, network mappers, and port scanners to identify weaknesses in the target's infrastructure.

Exploitation: This phase involves using the information and vulnerabilities identified in the previous phase to launch attacks against the target. 
This can involve using tools such as Metasploit, SQLMap, and social engineering techniques to gain access to the target's systems and data.

Reporting: This phase involves documenting the results of the web recon and presenting them in a clear and concise format that can be easily understood by stakeholders. This can involve creating reports that summarize the vulnerabilities identified, the risks posed to the organization, and the recommendations for mitigating these risks.
